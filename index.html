<p class="top_text">Our laboratory is interested in elucidating the molecular basis of human disease and in using this information to guide development of new and safer therapies.

<p class="name">Cell-matrix Interactions: Structure-activity Relationships in Integrins</p>

<p class="text">Integrins are αβ heterodimeric cell adhesion receptors of metazoa consisting of a bilobular head and two legs that each spans the plasma membrane once. Integrins are unusual receptors, as they normally exist on the cell surface in an inactive state, unable to engage physiologic ligand. This is critical for integrin biology, for example, it allows patrolling blood platelets and immune cells to circulate with minimal aggregation or interaction with the vessel walls. Physiologic stimuli (e.g. chemokines), acting through the short integrin cytoplasmic tails, induce allosteric changes in the large extracellular domain required for extracellular ligand binding (“inside-out” activation). Binding of physiologic ligands then induces “outside-in” signaling by initiating additional shape changes in the extracellular domain, triggering changes in how sticky cells become. Disruption of these processes can make cells more sticky, leading to clogged arteries, pathological inflammation, autoimmunity, fibrosis or cancer, or slippery, leading to bleeding or infections.  Our studies aim at elucidating the structural changes in integrins at the atomic level and using this information in a structure-based approach to design new and safer drugs to treat a wide variety of diseases.</p>

<p class="name">Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD)</p>

<p class="text">ADPKD is the most common monogenic disease in humans, caused by dysregulation in diameter of tubular structures such as kidney tubules and blood vessels. ADPKD is caused by defects in one of two genes, PKD1 or PKD2. ADPKD leads to progressive loss of kidney function, and can result in catastrophic brain hemorrhage from ruptured vascular cysts. We have shown that defective PKD1 causes cysts in a mouse model, and that it cooperates with PKD2 to mediate calcium influx into cells, thus regulating cell migration, polarity and proliferation. Ongoing work is aimed at elucidating factors that regulate tube diameter during organ development, using zebrafish as a convenient animal model.</p>

<div class="project">

<p class="name">Cell Fate Determination in the Hematopoietic System</p>

<p class="text">The hematopoietic system originates from a small population of self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells that differentiate into the various erythroid, myeloid, and B and T lymphoid lineages. The hematopoietic lineages tend to be specified in a stepwise process of binary decisions, dependent on particular genetic programs under control of transcription factors. The lineage-specifying and autoregulatory factors PU.1 and GATA1 form a master genetic switch that is responsible for determining the myeloid/lymphoid and erythroid lineages, respectively, commonly acting in concert with lineage-restricted factors such as SCL/TAL1 and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα). We have shown that ZBP-89 (Zfp148), which belongs to a novel class of GC-rich binding transcription factors, regulates developmental fate of hemangioblasts, the precursors of hematopoietic and vascular stem cells at the embryonic stage.  ZBP-89 also regulates stress hematopoiesis in the adult bone marrow, revealed in experiments using conditional ZBP-89  knockout mice. Ongoing studies are aimed at elucidating the underlying mechanisms.</p>

<div class="project">

<p class="name">Kidney Regeneration</p>
<p class="text">Despite decades of research and advances in patient-care, mortality rates for patients with acute kidney injury have not significantly decreased. The mammalian kidney possesses the inherent potential for regeneration and recovery of tubular function following acute injury, through recruitment and proliferation of surviving tubular epithelium. However, limitation in the number of surviving tubular cells commonly leads to progressive loss of renal function. The signaling pathways regulating tubular epithelial cell response to ischemic or toxic injury are incompletely understood. Stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1, also called Ly6a) is a glycerophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, commonly used as a marker for the identification and isolation of stem cell populations. We have shown that Sca-1 has a wider cell distribution in the adult kidney. Ongoing efforts are aimed at identifying the role Sca-1 plays in the adult kidney, using in vitro and in vivo models of tubular cell injury. </p>

<div class="project">

<p class="name">Engineering Kidney-assist Devices</p>

<p class="text">Accumulation of excess fluid and toxic metabolites are invariant consequences of kidney failure. Over the long-term, kidney problems have significant repercussions on cardiovascular system as well as on other organ systems. We are working with our engineering colleagues towards development of microfluidic devices and methods of filtering a liquid solution, which may find industrial or medical applications.  For example, such microfluidic devices provide particular advantages in blood dialysis and may be developed into portable kidney assist devices.</p>
