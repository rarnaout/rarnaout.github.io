<p class="name">Team charts the dollars and sense behind blood tests</p>
<p class="text">Doctors order too many blood tests, conventional
  wisdom goes, and repeat blood tests are helping bankrupt
  medicine. But is it true? A surprising new 15-year study by
  Dr. Arnaout and colleagues finds widespread underuse, as well as
  overuse, of this single highest-volume medical activity, with repeat
  tests just the tip of the iceberg. The team discusses the
  implications for patients, doctors, and the $3-trillion US
  healthcare economy. Out now in <i>PLoS One</i>.</p>
